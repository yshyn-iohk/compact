;;; Support analysis and body lowering — the largest file in the backend.
;;;
;;; Two jobs, and the split between them matters:
;;;
;;;   1. SUPPORT ANALYSIS. `body-walkable?` / `expr-supported?` decide
;;;      whether every construct in a body has a lowering, BEFORE anything
;;;      is emitted. This exists so a body is emitted or refused as a
;;;      whole (no half-written circuits in the output stream), and so an
;;;      unlowerable body can be routed to an alternative path such as the
;;;      streamed constructor form.
;;;   2. LOWERING. `emit-body-or-fallback` and `ctor-expr-rust` render
;;;      bodies and constructor expressions.
;;;
;;; The cost of the split: the walker and the emitters must both
;;; understand the same IR shapes, so a new construct generally needs
;;; handling in BOTH. A shape the emitter can render but the walker
;;; rejects is silently unsupported; the reverse is a crash.
;;;
;;; Also builds the witness / circuit / native id hashtables the emitters
;;; consult at call sites.
;;;
;;; See compiler/README-rust-passes.md for the module map and the three
;;; body routes (constructor / impure / pure).
