;;; The streamed constructor path.
;;;
;;; Most constructor bodies render as a single expression. Bodies that
;;; branch, or carry multiple asserts, cannot — they become a SEQUENCE of
;;; op-builder statements instead. `body-needs-streaming?` decides;
;;; `emit-streaming-body` renders.
;;;
;;; Note this file has the deepest nesting in the backend (tracked in
;;; MediaNoxLabs/compact#40). That is not only a readability problem: two
;;; catch-all `(guard (c [#t ...]) ...)` handlers once lived at the
;;; deepest point, swallowing deliberate rejections along with genuine
;;; emitter bugs. At that indentation, wrapping a call in a
;;; swallow-everything handler is easier than threading a failure out
;;; properly — so prefer extracting a named helper over nesting further.

      ;; leading const-bindings/asserts, then terminal Cell.write batch
      ;; OR terminal non-write public-ledger call OR terminal if-then-else.
      ;; Bodies like zerocash.spend, election.vote$commit, election.vote$reveal
      ;; need interleaved public-ledger calls, if-statements, and bare-call
      ;; statements in the middle of the body.

      ;; The streaming walker below dispatches per-statement and emits one
      ;; mini-OpProgramVerify chain per ledger-mutating statement; ctx is
      ;; threaded out via let-bound `_results_N` / `_if_results_N` values so
      ;; subsequent steps see the updated QueryContext. Gas costs are
      ;; accumulated through `__gas_acc += results.gas_cost`. Existing simple
      ;; shapes still go through emit-body-or-fallback for byte-stable output;
      ;; only richer shapes fall through to this walker.
